<h2>Austin Mleziva</h2>
Hi, Austin Mleziva here. You may be wondering how to pronounce that last name. Try "muh-lez-ih-vah". See, that wasn't too difficult, despite the rare "ml" start followed by a scary "z" and frightening "v". But don't worry, I won't be upset if you mess it up. I have heard many different variations I didn't even think were possible. You can just call me Austin though and that will be easier.   

<h3>Want to work with me?</h3>
I have a deep love for entrepreneurship, startups, and small businesses. Please don't hesitate to send me an email <div class="email">austinmleziva@<span>gmail.</span>com</div>
